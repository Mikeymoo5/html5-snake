# html5-snake
A basic game of snake made with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript
Uses no external libraries - just pure HTML, CSS, and JS (eruda is used only for developement - i will remove it in the final version)

Im really new to maintaining an open source project, so what I do with this project may be different than standard practices. 
The beta branch is where i will be pushing all the small updates, and then I will periodically merge with the main branch after bigger changes.
